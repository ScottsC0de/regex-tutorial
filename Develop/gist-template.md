Regex's email validation code is used to ensure an email is valid to enter a site, complete a form, sign-up for site memberships, etc. It is crucial on the internet and in the world of Web Development. I have chosen this Regex expression because I feel it is the most important for user interaction. 

Snippet of Email Validation Code:

```js
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
